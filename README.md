#Project Overview
The purpose of the analysis is to improve synthesis of data using Microsoft Excel to provide relevant details required. In this case, time,success rates and categories influence the charts required.
##Analysis and Challenges
###Analysis
The analysis of the data for part one of the challenge required data to be filtered into categories, launch dates to be confirmed into date formats and the creation of pivot tables and charts showing theater outcomes vs launch dates.

 The second part of the challenge required the use of the Countifs formula and the creation of an additional chart. This information was used to analyze outcomes based on goals for plays.
###Challenges
The main challenge encountered for me was using the countifs formula to work to further filter criteria to plays. Eventually with the assistance of both a TA and classmate this was accomplished. I realized when one step is incorrect it throws the entire sheet off. In this regard while I understood the formula required my data still remains incorrect and was unable to figure out which step was not accurate or omitted.
##Results
During the period 2010-2013, despite having very few theater outcomes, there were all successful. 2014-2016 there was a significant increase in launches but a significant increase in cancelations and failures with a rapid decline in 2017.

The number of successful outcomes for plays were in the Goal range under $1000 to up to $15000. The higher outcome range was less successful from $20000 and up.

A limitation to the data set is that the data is the accuracy of the data provided and the location and populations and the interests. I would include an age category, location to further analyze the contributions made. This would assist in informing which age group would provide improved funding.
